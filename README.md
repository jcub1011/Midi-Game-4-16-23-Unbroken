# Midi-Game-4-16-23-Unbroken
The original plan was to create a game like guitar hero but with a piano. I then found out about Synthesia which does it a lot better than I ever could so I decided to scrap the project. The code is up for grabs if anyone would like to use any of the algorithms. The midi preview is completely functional though performance is lacking.
